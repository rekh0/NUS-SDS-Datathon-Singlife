This function takes in a data set and make predictions using the Decision tree model from 2.3 that was trained using the data sent to us.

This input data set must be cleaned first (i.e. removing NAs, converting to numerical data, filling in NAs) and the top 50 features must be selected. All these follows the same process from 1.1 to 1.5.
